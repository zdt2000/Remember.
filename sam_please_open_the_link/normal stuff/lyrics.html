            [Verse 1]
            As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
            I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
            But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
            You know, I shun fancy things like electricity
            At 4:30 in the mornin' I'm milkin' cows
            Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows, fool
            And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
            Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
            I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
            Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
            But if I finish all of my chores, and you finish thine
            Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699

            [Chorus]
            We been spending most our lives
            Living in an Amish paradise
            I've churned butter once or twice
            Living in an Amish paradise
            It's hard work and sacrifice
            Living in an Amish paradise
            We sell quilts at discount price
            Living in an Amish paradise

            [Verse 2]
            A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
            I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
            I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
            'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell
            But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
            An Amish with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
            I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
            And my homies agree, I really look good in black, fool
            If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
            We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
            But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
            We're just technologically impaired

            [Bridge]
            There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
            Not a single luxury
            Like Robinson Crusoe
            It's as primitive as can be

            [Chorus]
            We been spending most our lives
            Living in an Amish paradise
            We're just plain and simple guys
            Living in an Amish paradise
            There's no time for sin and vice
            Living in an Amish paradise
            We don't fight, we all play nice
            Living in an Amish paradise

            [Verse 3]
            Hitchin' up the buggy, churning lots of butter
            Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another
            Think you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart?
            Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
            I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
            On my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife
            So don't be vain and don't be whiny
            Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie
